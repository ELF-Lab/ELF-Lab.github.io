          Dr. Christopher Hammerly is Director of ELF-Lab and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at UBC. He is a member (descendent) of the White Earth Nation in Minnesota of mixed Anishinaabe and Norwegian American descent. His work primarily focuses on his ancestral language Anishinaabemowin. He uses a variety of methods to understand the cognitive representations and processes underpinning human knowledge of syntax (sentence structure) and morphology (word structure), including formal theories, fieldwork, computational models, and experimental tasks.

          Anna Stacey is an MA student at UBC Linguistics, where she works on technological developments for Indigenous languages.  She got her BSc in Computer Science and Linguistics from UManitoba in 2022.  Anna has been developing software for ELF Lab as an RA for 2&#43; years, working on code for eye-tracking experiments (VisualWorldTools) and creating tests for the Ojibwe morphological parser (ParserTools).  She is also involved in fieldwork on Nɬeʔkepmxcín, a Salish language spoken in the Pacific Northwest.  In her free time, she loves heading outside to work on her knowledge of flowers and birds, and making music.
          
      
      
          Marcella Jurotich is a first-year master’s student in Linguistics at UBC. Her research interests are in syntax and psycholinguistics, particularly in the interaction between Information Structural elements and syntax and the processing of non-canonical structures. She is excited to be part of the ELF-Lab and to be able to learn more about Anishinaabemowin. In her spare time, she enjoys embroidering, dancing, and playing piano.
          
      
      
          Mila Loginova is an MA Linguistics student interested in Indigenous language preservation and documentation. She got her BA in Cognitive Science of Language from McMaster University, where she first encountered Anishinaabemowin and found herself fascinated by the morphology and syntax of the language. In the ELF-lab, she’s one of the people working on the Anishinaabemowin corpus.
          
      
      
          Minh Nguyen is a recent graduate of the UBC Master of Data Science -  Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL) program, with a background in Computer Science and Finance. He has a distinct passion for languages and programming. He is involved in exciting projects such as machine translation with the Ojibwe language and data construction. Outside of his professional endeavors, he holds a keen interest in general AI and physics, particularly in quantum physics.
