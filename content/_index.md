## Welcome to the homepage of the ELF Lab at UBC! 
The UBC **E**xperimental **L**inguistics and **F**ieldwork Lab (ELF-Lab; Directed by Professor Christopher Hammerly) seeks to bring advanced experimental and computational techniques such as eye tracking to fieldwork settings around the world. The aim of the lab is to produce findings applicable to answering theoretical questions within linguistics and psychology, as well as to boosting language reclamation and documentation efforts of Indigenous languages of North America.
