## Current Members
|     |  |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Dr. Christopher Hammerly** is Director of ELF-Lab and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at UBC. He is a member (descendent) of the White Earth Nation in Minnesota of mixed Anishinaabe and Norwegian American descent. His work primarily focuses on his ancestral language Anishinaabemowin. He uses a variety of methods to understand the cognitive representations and processes underpinning human knowledge of syntax (sentence structure) and morphology (word structure), including formal theories, fieldwork, computational models, and experimental tasks.   | ![Chris Hammerly Headshot](/images/ChrisHeadshot.jpeg)    |
## MA Students
|     |  |
| -------- | ------- |
|  **Anna Stacey** is an MA student at UBC Linguistics, where she works on technological developments for Indigenous languages.  She got her BSc in Computer Science and Linguistics from UManitoba in 2022.  Anna has been developing software for ELF Lab as an RA for 2+ years, working on code for eye-tracking experiments (VisualWorldTools) and creating tests for the Ojibwe morphological parser (ParserTools).  She is also involved in fieldwork on Nɬeʔkepmxcín, a Salish language spoken in the Pacific Northwest.  In her free time, she loves heading outside to work on her knowledge of flowers and birds, and making music.  | ![Anna Stacey Headshot](/images/AnnaHeadshot.jpeg) |
|  **Marcella Jurotich** is a first-year master’s student in Linguistics at UBC. Her research interests are in syntax and psycholinguistics, particularly in the interaction between Information Structural elements and syntax and the processing of non-canonical structures. She is excited to be part of the ELF-Lab and to be able to learn more about Anishinaabemowin. In her spare time, she enjoys embroidering, dancing, and playing piano.  | ![Marcella Jurotich Headshot](/images/MarcellaHeadshot.jpeg) | 
|  **Mila Loginova** is an MA Linguistics student interested in Indigenous language preservation and documentation. She got her BA in Cognitive Science of Language from McMaster University, where she first encountered Anishinaabemowin and found herself fascinated by the morphology and syntax of the language. In the ELF-lab, she’s one of the people working on the Anishinaabemowin corpus.  | ![Mila Loginova Headshot](/images/MilaHeadshot.jpeg) |
|  **Minh Nguyen** is a recent graduate of the UBC Master of Data Science -  Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL) program, with a background in Computer Science and Finance. He has a distinct passion for languages and programming. He is involved in exciting projects such as machine translation with the Ojibwe language and data construction. Outside of his professional endeavors, he holds a keen interest in general AI and physics, particularly in quantum physics.  | ![Minh Nguyen Headshot](/images/MinhHeadshot.jpg) |

**Cindy Zhang** is a student in UBC's MDS-CL program, and has been working as a volunteer Research Assistant in our project to build a text-based corpus for Ojibwe. She has focused on text processing for integration into the corpus infrastucture.

**Changbing Yang** is PhD student in Linguistics at UBC, and has worked in ELF-Lab to conduct eye tracking work on phonetic processing.

**Reed Steiner** is a PhD student in Linguistics at UBC, and has worked in ELF-Lab as a Research Assistant on projects related to Ojibwe phonological stem classes and the OjibweMorph Finite State Transducer.

## BA Students
|     |  |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Hope Trischuk** is a fifth-year undergraduate student studying Linguistics at UBC with specific interest in Indigenous language revitalization. She has been involved with ELF lab for three years where her responsibilities have included everything from developing studies about learners of Anishinaabemowin to mastering the label-maker. Participating in fieldwork and developing the related skills with ELF has been a highlight of her university career. Outside of linguistics, she enjoys hosting friends for her renowned risotto dinners and working towards perfection in the video game Stardew Valley (which is much more achievable than in real life).     | ![Hope Trischuk Headshot](/images/HopeHeadshot.JPG) |

**Jolie Lepere** is a recent graduate in Linguistics from UMass Amherst, and has been working as a volunteer Research Assistant in our project to build a text-based corpus for Ojibwe. She has focused on correcting errors in the digitial versions of the texts.

**Grace Zhang** is a recent graduate of UBC, and has been working as a volunteer Research Assistant in our project to build a text-based corpus for Ojibwe. She has primarily focused on improving OCR pipelines and optimizing our error correction process.

**Matthias Diederichsen** is an undergraduate in Linguistics and Computer Science at UBC and is currently working on FST disambiguation and constraint grammars for Ojibwe.
