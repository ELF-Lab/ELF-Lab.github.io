At the end of February, our Director Dr.Hammerly was invited as a plenary speaker to the Language Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference. This conference run by UBC undergraduates is a celebration of the exciting research done by undergraduates across Canada. 

Dr. Hammerly was invited to speak on the various projects being developed at ELF Lab relating to technology's role in language revitalization. 

Additionally, our undergraduate RA, Hope Trischuk, gave an oral presentation on her work with ELF lab: Assessing Intuitions about Obviation in Learners of Anishinaabemowin. 
For her efforts, she was awarded first place in the Oral Presentation category!

Congratulations to Hope and Dr. Hammerly! We extend our gratitude to the LSURC team and fellow undergraduate researchers!
